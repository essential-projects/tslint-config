# DEPRECATED

TSLint has been replaced by ESlint.
Use ESLint and our [ESLint-config](https://github.com/essential-projects/eslint-config) instead!

# TSLint config for process-engine packages

- install with `npm install --save-dev @essential-projects/tslint-config`
- create a tslint.json in your project with the following content:

```json
{
    "extends": "@essential-projects/tslint-config"
}
````

This is based on the [5Minds tslint config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-config-5minds).
